# About

This is a resouce hub for students enrolled in Writing with Digital Technologies at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. You will find tutorials that combine videos and written instructions to help you though your tech-heavy course projects. 

Writing with Digital Technologies is a "Writing Studies course that explores current and emerging digital writing technologies and provides opportunities to assess writing situations and make appropriate decisions about digital form, production, and scholarship.  Students learn the basic building blocks of writing in Internet environments (text, sound, images, video, interactivity) as well as the vocabularies, functionalities, and organizing structures of Web 2.0 environments, how these impact understanding and use of information, how to produce these environments (i.e., multimedia internet documents) for interactivity and use, and recent scholarship on their use. This course includes practice with markup language and structured authoring." 

We look forward to working with you this semester!
