## About

This is a resouce hub for students enrolled in Writing with Digital Technologies at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. You will find tutorials and resources to help you though your tech-heavy course projects. 

Writing with Digital Technologies is a course that, as Prof. Duin describes, "provides opportunities to assess writing situations and make appropriate decisions about digital form, production, and scholarship." You are encouraged to challenge your technological limits, and test your skills with the technologies we discuss in this course and beyond.
