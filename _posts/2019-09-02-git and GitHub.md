## Introduction
**What is Git?** Git is a distributed version-control system (DVCS) for tracking changes in source code during software development.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git. “Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository.” https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/. “Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate.” https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F. This makes Git an ideal version control system for small individual projects like those in this course. 

**What is GitHub?** “GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.” https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/

**What is a repository?** “A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.” https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/. 

**Why should I care?** Git and GitHub will allow you to create and share your content, while also keeping track of any changes that you make to your content as you work. This is particularly useful when coding a project, as you may need to backtrack to find and resolve issues in your code. 

## Set up a Git / GitHub Repository
### Before you begin:
-Download Atom text editor

2. Setup GitHub Desktop
3. Clone template website files
4. Create local Git repository
5 .Push the local Git repository to GitHub (master) - This is still local to you
