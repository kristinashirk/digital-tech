## HTML
 HTML is everywhere, and is becoming an essential skill in the age of Web 2.0. It is also a great introduction to structured authoring, which, as technical writers, will be your bread and butter. It is also a great stepping stone for learning programming languages line Python, C#, and so on. You learn to make your content modular, to chunk it for ease of reading and reuse, that you need to consider inheritance when pulling all of the pieces together into a page. These are all essential skills for a technical writer, or programmer, front end developer, or any career that involves structured authoring or coding. 

There are an overwhelming amount of resources on the internet to learn HTML and web development. This article is designed to help you get started, and direct you to effective resources to aid you with your website projects.

### HTML Resources
The following is a list of resources that I rely on when building an HTML website from scratch:
* [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - W3schools provides great examples of HTML and CSS and help you create specific components of your website, like a navigation bar. w3schools is most useful when you already know what you want to do, and are looking for instruction on how to do that thing. Otherise, the lessons tend to lack context and can be confusing. 
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)- The Mozilla Developer Network has a lot of great informaiton about web development, and has a ton of tutorials and instructional articles to help you build your website. Much like w3schools, the Mozilla Developer Newtork is most effective when you already know what you are looking for.
* [https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css) - When you do not know exactly what you are looking for, Code Academy is a great place to start. Code Academy has great tutorials for all sorts of programming and markup languages. Their basic HTML and CSS tutorials are free. They also provided guided practice activities that are very helpful when you do not know where to start. 
* [https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) - Kahn Academy also has free HTML and CSS courses that are a great place to start when first learning HTML, or if you need a refresher. Kahn Academy tends to give more background information, so you  have a better understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. 
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) - This resource helps you choose colors to use for your website, and gives you the hexadecimal value for those colors that you can use in your CSS stylesheet. 
* [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/) - This resource validates your HTML code, checking that it will function properly. Validate your code often so you can catch issues early. I tend to validate my code after implementing a lot of changes or adding new content. 
* [http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php) - This resource is a detailed cheatsheet for HTML tags. 
* [http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/csscheatsheet.php](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/csscheatsheet.php) - This resource is a detailed cheatsheet for CSS elements.
