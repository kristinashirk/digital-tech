## HTML

 HTML is everywhere, and is becoming an essential skill in the age of Web 2.0. It is also a great introduction to structured authoring, which, as technical writers, will be your bread and butter. It is also a great stepping stone for learning programming languages line Python, C#, and so on. You learn to make your content modular, to chunk it for ease of reading and reuse, that you need to consider inheritance when pulling all of the pieces together into a page. These are all essential skills for a technical writer, or programmer, front end developer, or any career that involves structured authoring or coding. 

There are an overwhelming amount of resources on the internet to learn HTML and web development. This article is designed to help you get started, and direct you to effective resources to aid you with your website projects.

### HTML Foundations
Every HTML page you create for this course will need the following code to begin and end each page, so please copy and paste this block of code every time you create a fresh HTML file:

`<!doctype html>

<head>
  <title>TITLE GOES HERE</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CECT.css">
</head>

<body>
    WEBSITE BODY CONTENT GOES HERE
</body>

</html>`

The red text will never be visible, and is the “administrative” information that you need to define for your webpages.

This block begins with a declaration that the file you are creating is an HTML file, so the computer knows what it is reading when it parses the file. 
`<!doctype html>`

Then you are state information about the website as a whole. You should input the title of your website within the `<title>` tags. 
 `<title>TITLE GOES HERE</title>`
  
This title will appear in the tabs of your internet browser: 
`<title>Writing with Digital Technologies</title>`
![HTML Tab Title Example]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/HTML_Title_Tabs.png)

Then you link your external CSS stylesheet, which details the look and feel of your website. 
`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CECT.css">`

Then you need to close the <head> tag with </head>. You must always close your tags in HTML. Otherwise a computer will not know where to stop reading a line and will assume that everything after `<head>` belongs in the head of your website, and will never appear on screen. 
`<head>
...
</head>`

I recommend, whenever you add a new tag, to close it out, and then input the content between the tags. For example, if you are adding a paragraph `<p>`, immediately type out the closing tag `</p>` before adding your paragraph text. 

Content within the `<body> </body>` tags will appear on screen and make up your webpages. 

### CSS
CSS  is a rule-based language, in which you define the rules, to specify styles that will be applied to your HTML document. CSS converts this:
